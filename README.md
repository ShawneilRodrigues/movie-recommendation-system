# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview

The Movie Recommendation System provides personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and behavior. It utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to suggest movies that match users' tastes, improving their movie-watching experience.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations:** Offers tailored movie suggestions based on user preferences.
- **User Profile Management:** Allows users to create and manage profiles for more accurate recommendations.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to suggest movies based on user similarity.
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends movies based on content similarity.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Programming language used for implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Scikit-Learn:** For building and training machine learning models.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Flask/Django:** (Specify if using) For developing the web interface.
- **SQL/NoSQL Database:** For storing user data and movie information.
